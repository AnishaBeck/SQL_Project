# SQL_Project

This project is to practice SQL on real dataset.
e'll be working with a version of a database called Chinook . The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store.

The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables. Like with our Factbook database, a schema diagram will help us understand the available columns and the structure of the data. Here's a schema diagram for the Chinook database:
